# Face Retrieval with Metric Learning and Textual Descriptions

**Introduction:**

This repository implements a Face Retrieval system that leverages Metric Learning and textual descriptions to find similar faces in a dataset. It builds upon the idea that images and their corresponding textual attributes can be embedded into a shared space, enabling efficient retrieval based on semantic similarities.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR):** This technique retrieves images based on their content rather than metadata.
* **Metric Learning:** This approach learns an embedding space where similar images are mapped closer together based on a distance metric.
* **Triplet Loss:** A loss function commonly used in metric learning, enforcing a margin between the distances of a query image to its positive and negative counterparts.

**Model Architecture:**

The model consists of three main components:

* **Image Encoder:** Processes an image and extracts its visual features. (Implementation in `ImageEncoder` class)
* **Text Encoder:** Processes textual attributes and extracts their semantic representations. (Implementation in `TextEncoder` class)
* **Triplet Loss Function:** Calculates the loss based on the distances between the query image embedding, a positive image embedding with matching attributes, and negative image embeddings with different attributes. (Implemented in `VisualHuntNetwork` class)

**Code Structure:**

* `VisualHuntNetwork.py`: Defines the main network architecture, including the projection layers for image and text embeddings, the distance function, and the triplet loss calculation.
* Potentially other files (`ImageEncoder.py`, `TextEncoder.py`): These might contain the implementations for image and text encoders depending on the chosen architecture.

**Dependencies:**

* PyTorch
* SentenceTransformers
* HuggingFace
* Pandas
* NumPy

**Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://<github_repository_url>
